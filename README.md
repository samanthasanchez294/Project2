**Introduction**
  My app uses the Tastedrive API which can recommend you movies, shows, or music based on your favorite artists or shows. I think it is an 
  iknteresting app to have because you can use to explore your interest while also finding something that is interesting to your taste. An example
  could be if your favorite artist is Taylor Swift and you want to expand your taste with similar music, you could use this app to get maximum 10 
  similar artists.

**Usability Goals**
  I wanted my webapp to not only be easy to use but also to look nice, I wanted to use the sidebar as the main element where the user searches 
  and gets to control the output. It terms of asthetic elements i chose blue hues to have the website cohesive but to also have it stand out. 
  There are tabs where the user can move from to find different information and overall I think this webapp is easy to use while also it being fun.

**Design Process**
  I dont have any sketches made but I did from the start want the main element be the sidebar. I think it is a good way to keep the search 
  seperated from the rest of the home page and a more clean look for the webapp. Then with the requirement of tabs and charts the website 
  started to build itself in a way.

**API Integration**
  I do think that working with an API was a bit harder then I expected and I also think that some API's were harder to work with than others. I 
  think the biggest challenge I faced was that with the API I choose there wasnt much information to be used when creating a map and bar chart. 
  This API only grabed information of recommended things and some URLs to music videos and wikipedia pages. I wanted to integrate using another API
  in order to have more relevant information but I started to get more complications and decided to just use the one API.

**Widgets Explanation**
    For widgets I included a radio button to have the user select what recommendations they want (music, shows, movies, ect.). I also added a 
    text_input box and slider for the number of recommendations. Tabs, buttons, and a checkbox are used too.

**HCI Principles**
  I made sure to make every control visible and include any error messages/success messages. The layouts are consistent and there is error 
  prevention based on what the user inputs.
  

**Conclusion and Future Improvements**
  I think a future improvement that i want to make is to integrate another API to have the maps present more relevant information as well as the 
  bar chart. I think with these elements the website could elevate and become a great website to use.
